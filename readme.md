# Installation

Clone this repository into your local machine.
`git clone https://github.com/0xatulpatil/collabcode.git`

Once cloned, head over to inside the repository folder. You will see two files. Open first terminal and then `cd server `.

Then install the node modules using `npm install`.

Once all the modules are installed, start the server by entering
`node index.js`.

Now open another instance of terminal in the cloned repository. Now enter into the client folder using `cd client1`.

Again install all the required node modules using `npm install`.

Once all the modules are installed, you can start your client using `npm run start`. This will serve the client at `http://localhost:3000/`

Head over to `http://localhost:3000/join`.
